# Interactive front-end dashboard with `Streamlit`

#### Python version: 3.10.6

This repository used the 
[Airbnb Berlin Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/airbnb-berlin-price-prediction) 
data set from Kaggle to create an application.

#### You can interact with the final application [here](https://airbnbberlinpriceprediction-aqsebz46drxajvbpmdsvwr.streamlit.app/).

The aim of this repository was to make an interactive front-end dashboard for interacting with a machine learning model.

The focus was on the front-end dashboard and not on the model accuracy. Therefore the predictions of the model are quite bad!

Model: `RandomForestRegressor`

Hyperparameters:

- Max depth = 10
- Minimum samples leaf = 20
- Number of estimators = 150
